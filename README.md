Hello, thank you for visiting my github page!

I am Aasavari, a M.S. in Applied Math candidate at Stanford with specialization in Artificial Intelligence. 
Prior to Stanford, I completed B.Tech in Math and Computing at IIT Delhi where I excelled in Statistics. 


At Stanford, I studied - cs224n (NLP), cs224u (NLU), cs231n (CV), cs224w (Graph Neural Networks) and cs229 (ML). 
During my research projects and ML internships, I worked on -
1. Weakly Supervised networks, 
2. Semi-supervised networks, 
3. Multimodal representation learning, 
4. Transfer Learning, 
5. state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Composition,
6. Knowledge Graph completion. 

I am actively interviewing for full-time Data Science and Machine Learning roles. If you're hiring, let's connect at adkakne at stanford dot edu!
Thank you!
